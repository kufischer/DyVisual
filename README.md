# DyVisual
Source Code of DyVisual extensions to FiVES for the TRW and Whirlpool use cases.

Each of the following folders contains a prototypical app which can be used independent of each other.
Interested users can use the code to create their own apps.
The apps do not interfere with each other. So it should be easily possible to run them on a single Tomcat/FiVES installation.

To run the apps one needs to have a Web server(we recomend Apache Tomcat 8.0 [http://tomcat.apache.org/]) and
FiVES (you can download FiVES here: https://github.com/fives-team/fives).

Each of the apps brings along its own README.md file which explains how to deploy the app:

Whirlpool\WhirlpoolFiVES: App for displaying deviation maps for the Whirlpool use cases using FiVES for data updates and synchronization
Whirlpool\WhirlpoolFiVES: Standalone app for displaying deviation maps for the Whirlpool use case which does not need the installation of FiVES
