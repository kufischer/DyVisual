# DyVisual\Whirlpool\WhirlpoolApp

Source Code of the DyVisual Web app for displaying deviation maps.

Copy the content of this folder to a folder which can be accessed by a Web server. Connect with Google Chrome or Firefox to this Web server and ask for the file index.html.
The URI depends of course on where you put the folder which contains index.html and the rest of the data.
If you would want to change the directory structure of the app, you would need to know what you are doing.

Please Note: In case Google Chrome complains that it does not support XML3D, it is most likely that the graphics card of your machine has been blacklisted for security reasons which are related to WebGL. There are no reports on similar behaviour of Firefox.
